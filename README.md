# Summary
Phishing is when someone attempts to fraudulently obtain your personal information and security credentials via an electronic message that impersonates a trustworthy entity. The message will often instruct you to follow a link and then enter your personal information. 

At ANZ, we receive thousands of email everyday, as a part of the security team, We have been assigned SEVEN emails to investigate. Some of these emails may contain content which can be classed as malicious, due to a number of reasons. They may contain malicious attachments, suspicious links, or Phishing attempts to gather private account information from the users. 

**In this project,** we will identify whether the emails are malicious or safe. If there is a malicious content within the emails, we will need to write a brief report detailing why it is malicious.

**Our Goal,**  once we find out the status of the email, we will either block the email or release to the user.
